Every App has its own updateInterval. If it is set to 0, it means that this app together with the other apps will be updated after a global period. (Systemsettings->updateInterval).   
This setting is sufficient for most apps not to exhaust the API quota.  
However, if desired, the interval at which the app fetches new data can be forced. Just enter a timespan in seconds (minimum 10s).

AWTRIX has its own appstore.  
Here all tested apps are provided and can be downloaded or updated.
